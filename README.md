Instead do purely from WebGazer and run

```
cd WebGazer/www
npm i
npm run serve
```

From here we can simply add code to antisaccade.html

---

Run both backend and frontend in seperate terminals, and make sure to have backend running first

#### Running Backend

```
cd api
npm i
npm start
```

#### Running Frontend

```
cd eyetest
npm i
npm start
```
